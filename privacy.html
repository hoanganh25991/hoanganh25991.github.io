    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This game is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs entirely in your browser/device.
      We do not operate any backend servers for the game and we do not collect, store, or process
      any personal information on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or require any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account creation or sign-in</li>
      <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact details</li>
      <li>Analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking</li>
      <li>Advertising IDs or user profiling</li>
      <li>Precise location data</li>
      <li>Tracking cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>On-Device Storage Only</h2>
    <p>
      To enable gameplay features (e.g., remembering your settings or progress, enabling offline play),
      the game may store small amounts of data locally on your device using technologies such as
      localStorage, IndexedDB, or Cache Storage. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio, language, or control preferences</li>
      <li>Game progress and last played level</li>
      <li>Cached images, audio, or other static assets for offline use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers because we do not have any.
      You can delete this data at any time via your browser’s site data settings (for example:
      clear “Site data” or “Cookies and other site data” for this site).
    </p>

    <h2>Network Requests and Caching</h2>
    <p>
      The app may request static game assets (such as images, audio, or fonts) from the hosting domain
      to load or update content. These requests do not include personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a service worker is used for offline support, it only caches assets and data necessary for gameplay.
      Clearing your browser cache or site data will remove this cached content.
    </p>

    <h2>No Cookies, Tracking, or Ads</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No tracking cookies</li>
      <li>No analytics or telemetry</li>
      <li>No third-party advertising</li>
      <li>No push notifications or background sync</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services and Hosting Logs</h2>
    <p>
      We do not integrate third-party SDKs or analytics. The game may be hosted by a third-party
      static hosting provider. Such providers may collect standard server logs (e.g., IP address,
      browser type) for security and operational purposes. We do not access, control, or combine any
      such logs with other information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game may contain optional links to external websites (for example, documentation or source code).
      Those sites are governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This game is suitable for a general audience and is designed without personal data collection.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently
      collected such information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because gameplay data remains on your device and we do not store any user data on servers,
      privacy risks are minimized. We recommend keeping your device, operating system, and browser
      up to date and protected.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
      with an updated “Last updated” date.
    </p>
